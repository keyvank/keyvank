Curious about my current occupation?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Ziesha Network](https://ziesha.network), a new layer-1 cryptocurrency which uses ZK-proofs under the hood to provide scalability.
- 🎸 I’m currently learning to play guitar, so more passionate and curious about music, thus also learning about computer synthesizers and sound wave generation 🎵
