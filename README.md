### Hi there 👋

This is 🪐Keyvan, a hardcore computer geek who, unlike all those boring so called "Software Engineers" 🙄, adores reinventing the wheel!

I have written:
 - 🐧 Operating Systems ([ZincOS](https://github.com/keyvank/zincos))
 - 💻 Computer Emulators ([Chip8Emu](https://github.com/keyvank/chip8emu))
 - 🎮 3D Rasterizers ([Tracy](https://github.com/keyvank/tracy))
 - 🎱 Ray Tracers ([Pyglare](https://github.com/keyvank/pyglare))
 - ⛓️ Blockchains ([Zeeka Network](https://github.com/zeeka-network/bazuka), [Project Daten](https://github.com/xdtlab/pydaten))
 - 🎭 Zero-Knowledge Proof Engines ([Pyrove](https://github.com/keyvank/pyrove), [Bellperson](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bellperson))
 - 😂 Fancy resumes (https://keyvan.me)
 - ✈️ Travel diaries ([ماتروشکا](https://matrushka.ir))

Curious about my current occupation?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Zeeka Network](https://zeeka.io), a new layer-1 cryptocurrency which uses ZK-proofs under the hood to provide scalability.
- 🎸 I’m currently learning to play guitar, so more passionate and curious about music, thus also learning about computer synthesizers and sound wave generation 🎵
- 🇷🇺 Изучаю русский язык! 👅
